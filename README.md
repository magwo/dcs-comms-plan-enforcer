# DCS Comms Plan Enforcer by Mags

Enforces radio presets and intraflight frequency according to a standardized comms plan, per coalition. Flight names are used to determine intraflight frequencies, see [comms_plan_example.json](comms_plan_example.json). Also checks and sets frequencies of AI flights such as tankers or AWACS.

## Requirements

* Windows
* DCS

## Installation

* Extract contents of zip file.
* Find and run comms-plan-enforcer.exe in extracted folder.

## Usage

* Find and run comms-plan-enforcer.exe in extracted folder.
* Enter filenames when prompted.

An example comms plan JSON is included in the application directory: `comms_plan_example.json`. Feel free to edit this file, or copy it to another location and edit your own comms plan. I recommend putting your comms plan file in your Missions folder in "Saved Games DCS", for easy access.

### Advanced usage

The exe file also supports command-line arguments on the format:

`comms-plan-enforcer.exe myMission.miz comms_plan_example.json myEnforcedMission.miz`

Any missing command-line arguments will result in a dialog.

You can specify comms plan for `red` and `neutrals` coalitions in the comms plan JSON file, by adding them on the same levelas "blue" in the JSON file.
